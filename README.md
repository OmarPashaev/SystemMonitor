A lightweight PowerShell system monitoring tool that logs CPU and RAM usage and issues configurable alerts for performance tracking.

## Project History

This project was originally developed earlier and used locally. It was uploaded to GitHub on March 27, 2025, as part of an effort to organize and showcase my work publicly.


## Features
- Logs CPU and RAM usage every 30 seconds
- Saves logs as `.csv` files inside the `logs/` directory
- Shows popup alerts when CPU or RAM usage goes beyond 80%

## Configuration
Adjust settings in `config.ps1`:
- Logging interval (`$LogIntervalSeconds`)
- Thresholds (`$CPUThreshold`, `$RAMThreshold`)
- Log output directory

## How to Run
Right-click `monitor.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell". Make sure `config.ps1` is in the same folder.

### First Time Setup (Only Once)

If you get a warning when trying to run the script by right-click â†’ "Run with PowerShell", do the following:

1. Right-click `monitor.ps1` and `config.ps1`, choose **Properties**, and check **"Unblock"** if it's visible.
2. Open PowerShell and run this **once**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
